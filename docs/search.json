    "text": "The dataset used in this analysis contains English Premier League match data from the 2021-2022 season. The dataset includes 380 observations, corresponding to the 380 matches played over the course of a full season. Each match records performance statistics for both the home and away teams.\nThe variables I am most interested in are shots taken and fouls committed by the home and away teams. These variables provide insight into team playing styles, particularly whether home teams tend to play a more attacking style by generating more shots, and whether away teams are forced into a more defensive approach, potentially committing more fouls. Other metrics to also consider are corner kicks and yellow cards, as teams typically win more corners the more they attack, while yellow cards can indicate defensive play or time wasting tactics.\nThis leads to my primary question of interest:\nDo home teams play a more attacking style of soccer, while away teams adopt a more defensive style of play?\nThis data was accessed through the TidyTuesday project on a GitHub repository. The original source of the data is from Evan Gower on Kaggle.\nSome additional context about the Premier League is important for interpreting this data. The league consists of 20 teams, with each team playing 38 matches, once at home and once away against every other team. Match outcomes are scored as 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. Playing at home is widely believed to provide a competitive advantage due to factors such as crowd support, less traveling, better stadium amenities, and even differences in pitch dimensions.\nAs a result, teams often approach away matches more conservatively. Securing a draw away from home is typically considered a successful outcome, which encourages defensive strategies. In contrast, home matches are seen as opportunities to earn the maximum number of points, leading teams to adopt a more attacking style of play. Away teams may also attempt to slow the pace of the game through fouling or time-wasting, which can be reflected in higher foul counts and yellow cards.\nOverall, these contextual factors motivate an exploration of whether match statistics such as shots taken and fouls committed support the commonly held belief that home teams attack more, while away teams defend more."

This pattern suggests that home teams are generally more likely to play an attacking style of soccer. However, there is still a presence of negative values showing that matches end with the away team taking more shots. This indicates the home field advantage alone does not fully determine a team’s style of play, and that other factors such as overall team quality likely plays a role."

This suggests that in certain matches, away teams are forced into a more defensive style of play, relying heavily on fouling to disrupt the home team’s attacks and slow the pace of the game."

When the away team wins, the median shot difference is around -2, meaning that away victories typically occur when the away team is able to generate slightly more attacking opportunities than the home team.\nFor drawn matches, the median shot difference is about 2 suggesting that home teams still tend to take more shots even when the match ends level. Which is consistent with the idea that away teams often play more defensively and are satisfied with drawing matches away from home. When the home team wins, the median show difference rises to around 7, showing that home victories are strongly associated with attacking play style where the home team dominates the possession of the ball.\nOverall, this plot supports the narrative that home teams generally play a more attacking style, while the away team adopts more defensive strategies. The plot also shows that the amount of attacking pressure a team can apply is potentially associated with the outcome of the match."

    "text": "The data used in this analysis contains data on NFL stadium attendance, as well as time and day data on NFL games from the 2019 season (only games played during 2019) The dataset includes 299 observations, corresponding to the games played during this time period.\nThe variables I am most interested in are the weekly stadium attendance count which represents attendance for a single game, along with the day of week, time of day, and week within season the game took place. These variables provide insight into how attendance changes depending on when a game is played.\nThis leads to my primary question of interest:\nHow does NFL stadium attendance vary by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season\nThe data was accessed through the TidyTuesday project on a GitHub repository. The original source of the data is from Pro Football Reference.\nSome additional context about the NFL is important for interpreting this data. The league consists of 32 teams across the United States, meaning some teams play in colder climates than others. Additionally, some teams play in indoor stadiums where outdoor weather doesn’t impact the fan experience. As the season progresses into November and December, teams in colder locations may experience a drop in attendance due to harsher weather conditions.\nGames are typically played in one of three main time slots. One the east coast, these correspond roughly to 1:00pm (midday), 4:00pm (afternoon), and 8:00pm (primetime). The time a game starts could also affect attendance due to travel logistics, convenience, and how late the game ends. NFL games are usually played on Monday, Thursday or Sunday, with a few exceptions. This ties into kickoff time, as Monday and Thursday games are generally played during the primetime slot, so attendance may also be influenced by people’s work schedules or prior commitments.\nOverall, these contextual factors motivate an exploration of how NFL stadium attendance is impacted by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season."

It is interesting that the lowest average attendance was in week 6 at around 64,000 attendees, while the highest average attendance was in week 7 at around 69,000 attendees. Both of these weeks occurred during mid-October, and there are no obvious external factors that immediately explain why these two week are the furthest apart.\nOne possible explanation for the increase in attendance from week 6 to week 7 is variation in game quality. Week 7 may have featured more high profile matchups, stronger teams playing each other, or important rivalry games that attracted larger crowds.\nOverall, the plot suggests that average NFL stadium attendance remains relativelty stable throughout the season, with only small flucutations from week to week."

The median attendance is higher for primetime games, which makes sense because the NFL typically schedules its most high profile matchups in the primetime slot. These games often feature stronger teams which are more likely to draw larger crowds. The midday time slot has the lowest median attendance. This also aligns with expectations, as lower profile games are generally scheudled during this window, which may lead to slightly smaller crowds.\nLooking at the outliers and referencing the nfl_data dataframe, the high attendance outliers are primarily from the Dallas Cowboys as they have the largest stadium in the NFL by capacity. This naturally allows for higher attendance totals compared to other teams. On the lower end, the main outliers from the Los Angeles Chargers, who played their 2019 home games at a much smaller soccer stadium, as they were in the process of moving to a new permanent stadium. As a result, their attendance numbers were capped at a lower level than most other teams.\nOverall, this plot suggests that kickoff time does have a noticeable relationship with attendance, with primetime games generally drawing the largest crowds."

Looking first at Monday games, all of them occur in the primetime slot. Attendance for these games generally falls between 60,000 and 80,00 attendees, reflecting the importance of Monday Night Football and the tendency to schedule high profile games during this time.\nFor Thursday games, most also take place during the primetime slot, with the exception of a few games in late November. These are the Thanksgiving Day games, which include an afternoon game. This games shows the highest attendance among Thursday games largely because it was hosted by the Dallas Cowboys, who have the largest stadium in the NFL, and it is a NFL tradition for the Cowboys to host a Thanksgiving game. There are also a small number of Saturday games, which tpyically occur late in the season once the college football regular season has finished. These games provide additional national viewing opportunities and tend to follow similar attendance patterns to Sunday games.\nSunday games make up the majority of the schedule and include games across all three time slots. Most Sunday games fall between 60,000 and 80,000 attendees, though there are some outliers due to differences in stadium capacity. Compared to weekday games, there are more games below 60,000 attendees largerly because many Sunday matchups are played in the midday and afternoon time slots, which tend to draw slightly smaller crowds on average.\nOverall, across the full season, attendance appears relatively stable, with variations more strongly associated with time slot and stadium capacity than with the specific week of the season."
