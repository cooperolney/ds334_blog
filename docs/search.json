    "text": "The dataset used in this analysis contains English Premier League match data from the 2021-2022 season. The dataset includes 380 observations, corresponding to the 380 matches played over the course of a full season. Each match records performance statistics for both the home and away teams.\nThe variables I am most interested in are shots taken and fouls committed by the home and away teams. These variables provide insight into team playing styles, particularly whether home teams tend to play a more attacking style by generating more shots, and whether away teams are forced into a more defensive approach, potentially committing more fouls. Other metrics to also consider are corner kicks and yellow cards, as teams typically win more corners the more they attack, while yellow cards can indicate defensive play or time wasting tactics.\nThis leads to my primary question of interest:\nDo home teams play a more attacking style of soccer, while away teams adopt a more defensive style of play?\nThis data was accessed through the TidyTuesday project on a GitHub repository. The original source of the data is from Evan Gower on Kaggle.\nSome additional context about the Premier League is important for interpreting this data. The league consists of 20 teams, with each team playing 38 matches, once at home and once away against every other team. Match outcomes are scored as 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. Playing at home is widely believed to provide a competitive advantage due to factors such as crowd support, less traveling, better stadium amenities, and even differences in pitch dimensions.\nAs a result, teams often approach away matches more conservatively. Securing a draw away from home is typically considered a successful outcome, which encourages defensive strategies. In contrast, home matches are seen as opportunities to earn the maximum number of points, leading teams to adopt a more attacking style of play. Away teams may also attempt to slow the pace of the game through fouling or time-wasting, which can be reflected in higher foul counts and yellow cards.\nOverall, these contextual factors motivate an exploration of whether match statistics such as shots taken and fouls committed support the commonly held belief that home teams attack more, while away teams defend more."

Looking at extreme shot differences, the home team out shooting the away team by 15 or more shots is more common than the other way around. This pattern suggests that home teams are generally more likely to play an attacking style of soccer. However, there is still a presence of negative values showing that matches end with the away team taking more shots. This indicates the home field advantage alone does not fully determine a team’s style of play, and that other factors such as overall team quality likely plays a role."

This suggests that in certain matches, away teams are forced into a more defensive style of play, relying heavily on fouling to disrupt the home team’s attacks and slow the pace of the game."

When the away team wins, the median shot difference is around -2, meaning that away victories typically occur when the away team is able to generate slightly more attacking opportunities than the home team.\nFor drawn matches, the median shot difference is about 2 suggesting that home teams still tend to take more shots even when the match ends level. Which is consistent with the idea that away teams often play more defensively and are satisfied with drawing matches away from home. When the home team wins, the median show difference rises to around 7, showing that home victories are strongly associated with attacking play style where the home team dominates the possession of the ball.\nOverall, this plot supports the narrative that home teams generally play a more attacking style, while the away team adopts more defensive strategies. The plot also shows that the amount of attacking pressure a team can apply is potentially associated with the outcome of the match."

    "text": "The data used in this analysis contains data on NFL stadium attendance, as well as time and day data on NFL games from the 2019 season (only games during 2019) The data set includes 299 observations, corresponding to the games played over this time period.\nThe variables I am most interested in are the weekly stadium attendance count which is the attendance for a single game, and the day of week, time of day and week of the season the game took place. These variables provide insight into how many people attend NFL games depending on how chese variables change.\nThis leads to my primary question of interest:\nHow does NFL stadium attendance vary by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season\nThe data was accessed through the TidyTuesday project on a GitHub repository. The original source of the data is from Pro Football Reference.\nSome additional context about the NFL is important for interpreting this data. The league consists of 32 teams across the United States, meaning some teams play in colder climates than others, but some teams also play indoor stadiums where the outdoor climate doesn’t impact the attendees experience. So further into the season when it is in November and December, some teams could see a drop in attendance because of the colder conditions.\nAlso games are played at either a midday, afternoon, or a primetime slot, on the east coast these times correspond roughly to 1:00pm, 4:00pm, and 8:00pm. The time the game starts could also affect the attendance at the game because of travel concerns getting to the stadium and leaving the stadium at reasonable times. NFL games are typically played on Monday, Thursday or Sunday, with a few exceptions. This ties into the tie of day as Monday and Thursday games are also played during the primetime slot with a few exceptions, so attendance is impacted because of people’s work conflicts and prior commitments.\nOverall, these contextual factors motivate an exploration of how NFL stadium attendance is impacted by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season."

Both of these weeks occurred during mid October and no major events come to mind why these numbers are the furthest apart. A potential reason for the increase in attendance from week 6 to 7 is that there were more exciting games because better teams were playing each other or more rivalry games happened. Overall, this plot shows that the average NFL stadium attendance doesn’t change that much from week to week."

The median attendance is the highest for primetime games which make sense as the NFL typically schedules the best games for the primetime slot. The midday time slot has the lowest median attendance this also makes sense as the worst games are typically scheduled for this time. Looking at the outliers and the nfl_data dataframe, the high outliers come from the Dallas Cowboys as they have the largest stadium in the NFL so they can hold more people. The low outliers mainly come from the Los Angeles Chargers who played in a smaller soccer stadium during the 2019 season as they were in the process of moving permanent stadiums."

Looking at Monday, we can see that all the games occurred during the primetime slot and many games were in between 60,000 and 80,000 attendees. Moving to Thursday, many of the games also occurred during the primetime slot besides a couple of games in late November. These games were the Thanksgiving games, and we can see the afternoon game had the highest attendance for all Thursday games. This is because it has hosted by the Dallas Cowboys who have the largest stadium, and it is an NFL traditional for the Cowboys to host a thanksgiving game.\nNext is the couple of Saturday games, this only happens during one week during the season when there is no college football that week, and the people need something to watch on that Saturday. For Sunday games, they contain many games from all time slots, a majority of the games having between 60,000 and 80,000 attendees, with some outliers due to stadiums being bigger or smaller than usual. Also, compared to the weekday games, there are more games below 60,000 attendees because there are also more midday and afternoon games which are less desirable to go to. Over the course of the entire season the attendance remains the same for the most part."
