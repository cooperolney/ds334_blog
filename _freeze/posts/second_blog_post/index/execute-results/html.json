These variables provide insight into how attendance changes depending on when a game is played.\n \nThis leads to my primary question of interest:\n\n**How does NFL stadium attendance vary by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season**\n\nThe data was accessed through the TidyTuesday project on a GitHub repository. The original source of the data is from Pro Football Reference.\n\nSome additional context about the NFL is important for interpreting this data. The league consists of 32 teams across the United States, meaning some teams play in colder climates than others. Additionally, some teams play in indoor stadiums where outdoor weather doesn't impact the fan experience. As the season progresses into November and December, teams in colder locations may experience a drop in attendance due to harsher weather conditions.\n\nGames are typically played in one of three main time slots. One the east coast, these correspond roughly to 1:00pm (midday), 4:00pm (afternoon), and 8:00pm (primetime). The time a game starts could also affect attendance due to travel logistics, convenience, and how late the game ends. NFL games are usually played on Monday, Thursday or Sunday, with a few exceptions. This ties into kickoff time, as Monday and Thursday games are generally played during the primetime slot, so attendance may also be influenced by people's work schedules or prior commitments.\n\nOverall, these contextual factors motivate an exploration of how NFL stadium attendance is impacted by day of the week, kickoff time, and week within the season.\n\n# Primary Visualizations\n\n## Setting up the Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nattendance <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-02-04/attendance.csv')\ngames <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-02-04/games.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data Prep\ngames <- games |>\n  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))\n\nnfl_data <- games |>\n  left_join(attendance, by = c(\"home_team_city\" = \"team\",\n                               \"year\" = \"year\",\n                               \"week\" = \"week\")) |>\n  filter(year == 2019) |>\n  select(week, home_team, day, date, time, weekly_attendance) |>\n  mutate(\n    day = factor(day, levels = c(\"Mon\", \"Tue\", \"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\")),\n    date = mdy(paste0(date, \", \", 2019)),\n    hour = hour(time),\n    time_slot = case_when(\n      hour <= 13.5 ~ \"Midday\",\n      hour <= 17 ~ \"Afternoon\",\n      hour >= 19 ~ \"Primetime\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    )\n  ) |>\n  filter(!is.na(time_slot)) |>\n  mutate(time_slot = factor(time_slot, \n                            levels = c(\"Midday\", \"Afternoon\", \"Primetime\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 1: Mean NFL Stadium Attendance by Week\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnfl_data |>\n  group_by(week) |>\n  summarise(mean_attendance = mean(weekly_attendance, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = mean_attendance)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = week, xend = week, y = 0, yend = mean_attendance)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean NFL Stadium Attendance by Week\",\n    x = \"Week of Season\",\n    y = \"Average Attendance\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the lollipop plot, we can see that during the 2019 NFL season, average stadium attendance did not vary substantially from week to week. It is interesting that the lowest average attendance was in week 6 at around 64,000 attendees, while the highest average attendance was in week 7 at around 69,000 attendees. Both of these weeks occurred during mid-October, and there are no obvious external factors that immediately explain why these two week are the furthest apart. \n\nOne possible explanation for the increase in attendance from week 6 to week 7 is variation in game quality. Week 7 may have featured more high profile matchups, stronger teams playing each other, or important rivalry games that attracted larger crowds.\n\nOverall, the plot suggests that average NFL stadium attendance remains relativelty stable throughout the season, with only small flucutations from week to week.\n\n## Plot 2: NFL Stadium Attendance by Time Slot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(nfl_data, aes(x = time_slot, y = weekly_attendance, \n                     fill = time_slot)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NFL Stadium Attendance by Time Slot\",\n    x = \"Time Slot\",\n    y = \"Weekly Attendance\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the side-by-side boxplot, we can see that NFL stadium attendance was influenced by the game's time slot during the 2019 season. The median attendance is higher for primetime games, which makes sense because the NFL typically schedules its most high profile matchups in the primetime slot. These games often feature stronger teams which are more likely to draw larger crowds. The midday time slot has the lowest median attendance. This also aligns with expectations, as lower profile games are generally scheudled during this window, which may lead to slightly smaller crowds.\n\nLooking at the outliers and referencing the `nfl_data` dataframe, the high attendance outliers are primarily from the Dallas Cowboys as they have the largest stadium in the NFL by capacity. This naturally allows for higher attendance totals compared to other teams. On the lower end, the main outliers from the Los Angeles Chargers, who played their 2019 home games at a much smaller soccer stadium, as they were in the process of moving to a new permanent stadium. As a result, their attendance numbers were capped at a lower level than most other teams. \n\nOverall, this plot suggests that kickoff time does have a noticeable relationship with attendance, with primetime games generally drawing the largest crowds.\n\n## Plot 3: NFL Stadium Attendance by Date, Day, and Time Slot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(nfl_data, aes(x = date, y = weekly_attendance, color = time_slot)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~day, ncol = 1) +\n  xlim(as.Date(\"2019-09-01\"), as.Date(\"2020-01-05\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"NFL Stadium Attendance by Date, Day, and Time Slot\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Stadium Attendance\",\n    color = \"Time Slot\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis final plot examines how day of the week, time of day, and week within the season jointly relates to stadium attendance. Looking first at Monday games, all of them occur in the primetime slot. Attendance for these games generally falls between 60,000 and 80,00 attendees, reflecting the importance of Monday Night Football and the tendency to schedule high profile games during this time.\n\nFor Thursday games, most also take place during the primetime slot, with the exception of a few games in late November. These are the Thanksgiving Day games, which include an afternoon game. This games shows the highest attendance among Thursday games largely because it was hosted by the Dallas Cowboys, who have the largest stadium in the NFL, and it is a NFL tradition for the Cowboys to host a Thanksgiving game. There are also a small number of Saturday games, which tpyically occur late in the season once the college football regular season has finished. These games provide additional national viewing opportunities and tend to follow similar attendance patterns to Sunday games. \n\nSunday games make up the majority of the schedule and include games across all three time slots. Most Sunday games fall between 60,000 and 80,000 attendees, though there are some outliers due to differences in stadium capacity. Compared to weekday games, there are more games below 60,000 attendees largerly because many Sunday matchups are played in the midday and afternoon time slots, which tend to draw slightly smaller crowds on average.\n\nOverall, across the full season, attendance appears relatively stable, with variations more strongly associated with time slot and stadium capacity than with the specific week of the season.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, this analysis does not provide strong evidence that NFL stadium attendance varies substantially by week within the season. Average attendance appears relatively stable from week to week, suggesting that the timing within the season alone does not meaningfully impact how many fans attend games. There is, however, some evidence that attendance varies by time slot and day of the week. These two factors are closely related, as Monday and Thursday games are almost exclusively played in the primetime slot. Primetime games tend to show slightly higher attendance, which may be due to higher quality matchups, increased national attention, and scheduling that better fits fans’ work and personal commitments.\n\nOne limitation of this analysis is that it uses raw attendance counts rather than attendance as a percentage of stadium capacity. Stadium sizes vary significantly across the league. Because of these differences, attendance counts alone may reflect stadium capacity rather than true fan demand.\n\nWith additional data, a next step would be to incorporate each stadium’s maximum capacity and calculate an attendance rate. This would allow for a more meaningful comparison across teams and better isolate whether attendance truly changes by time of day, day of week, or week within the season. If attendance rate data were available, I would hypothesize that there would be greater variation later in the season compared to earlier weeks. Teams competing for playoff spots may experience sellout crowds, while teams that are no longer in contention may see reduced attendance. Using attendance rates instead of raw counts would make these differences easier to detect and interpret.\n\n# Connection to Class Ideas\n\nThe first plot uses a lollipop chart to display the mean attendance for each week of the season. Since my goal was to compare average attendance across weeks rather than examine the full distribution of values, a lollipop plot was an effective choice. It clearly emphasizes differences in means while minimizing visual clutter, making it easy to compare weeks side by side.\n\nFor the second plot, I used a side-by-side boxplot because it effectively displays the relationship between one quantitative variable (attendance) and one categorical variable (time slot). Boxplots are useful for comparing distributions, as they show the median, spread, and potential outliers within each group. This makes it easy to see how attendance differs across time slots. An unordered color palette was appropriate because time slot is a categorical variable without a numeric progression.\n\nFor the third plot, I faceted by the day and color coded by the time slot so that the plot was easier to read and so that viewers could see all the different variables at once. All the plots are intentionally simple, so viewers can quickly understand the patterns without being overwhelmed.\n\nFor the third plot, I used faceting by day of the week and color coding by time slot to allow viewers to examine multiple variables simultaneously. Both of these are effective ways to display multivariate relationships without overcrowding the plot. Overall, the plots were intentionally designed to be simple and uncluttered. By avoiding unnecessary complexity, the visualizations allow viewers to quickly interpret patterns in attendance without being overwhelmed by excessive detail.\n",
